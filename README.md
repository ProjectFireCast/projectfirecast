Project 100 - Online Podcast Studio (OPS)
City: Ballarat, Australia
Deadline: Online
The Problem:
Podcasting has consistently been becoming more popular year after year as businesses, special interest groups, and socialites try to improve their brand awareness and get their message out into the world. As the number of podcasts on offer increases, and the rate at which podcasts are produced climbs, there is an increasing need for content creators to be able to quickly create new episodes. 
The steps for creating a podcast are generally as follows:
• Set up the studio software
• Record the episode
• Edit the recording (Add sounds and music)
• Tag the episode with appropriate metadata (hashtags, content, captions)
• Export
• Distribute

The Solution:
Develop an online podcast studio inspired by the free library offered by HowlerJS. Ideally the online studio should feature (In order of importance):
• Online recording of the podcast
• Export of the recording into industry suitable formats.
• A sound board allowing sounds to be added while recording.
• Overlay of background music while recording is occurring.
• User-specific sound boards. Users can upload their own sounds. Requires user authentication.
The online studio should not require the user to download any software.
